# Stuff I did 🧠

A running log of what I worked on, changed, or learned while building this project.

## 🗓️ October 14th 2025 – Deprecating PXE Work
### 🧩 What I Did
- Decided to stop working on PXE setup for now.
- Created a `.gitignore` to exclude anything `PXE` related incase I want to revist the technology

### 🧠 Why
- All my attempts to setup PXE + kickstart setup failed
- I want to move on with this project, and setting up the PXE has wasted my time

### 💡 Lessons / Notes
- Learned how `.gitignore` works and how to untrack files without deleting them.
- Realized that I can come back to PXE later with better networking knowledge
